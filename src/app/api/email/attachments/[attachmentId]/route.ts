/**
 * /api/email/attachments/[attachmentId]: lazy inbound-attachment download.
 *
 * Bytes are never stored in Postgres (email_message_attachments holds metadata only,
 * see Task 4). This route is a thin wrapper: it resolves the signed-in actor, builds a
 * real mailbox client resolver (resolveProductionClient, the same one the worker uses), and delegates the authz-gated fetch to resolveAttachmentDownload, which is unit
 * tested with a fake Gmail client. A denied or missing attachment returns 404 (never a
 * 403, so existence of a private thread's attachment is never leaked).
